## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

  * **Python**: Follow the **PEP 8** style guide.
  * **Commit Messages**: Use prefixes like `Add:`, `Fix:`, `Update:`, `Refactor:`, or `Docs:`.
  * **Simplicity**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

### Security

  * **Never commit secrets** or credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.).
  * Use a `.env` file for all sensitive data.
  * Ensure that API keys or other secrets are not exposed in logs or printed to the console.

### Documentation

  * If you add a new feature or change the setup, please update the `README.md`.
  * Add clear docstrings to all new functions, classes, and modules.
